Voting\n power can be queried through the public accessors {getVotes} and {getPastVotes}.\n By default, token balance does not account for voting power. This makes transfers cheaper. The downside is that it\n requires users to delegate to themselves in order to activate checkpoints and have their voting power tracked.\n _Available since

This address can then be used for verification purposes.\n The `ecrecover` EVM opcode allows for malleable (non-unique) signatures:\n this function rejects them by requiring the `s` value to be in the lower\n half order, and the `v` value to be either 27 or 28.\n IMPORTANT: `hash` _must_ be the result of a hash operation for the\n verification to be secure: it is possible to craft signatures that\n recover to arbitrary addresses for non-hashed data. A safe way to ensure\n this is by receiving a hash of the original message (which may otherwise\n be too long), and then calling {toEthSignedMessageHash} on it."},"id":2343,"implemented":true,"kind":"function","modifiers":[],"name":"recover","nameLocation":"4317:7:14","nodeType":"FunctionDefinition","parameters":{"id":2322,"nodeType":"ParameterList","parameters":[{"constant":false,"id":2319,"mutability":"mutable","name":"hash","nameLocation":"4333:4:14","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":2343,"src":"4325:12:14","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes32","typeString":"bytes32"},"typeName":{"id":2318,"name":"bytes32","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"4325:7:14","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes32","typeString":"bytes32"}},"visibility":"internal"},{"constant":false,"id":2321,"mutability":"mutable","name":"signature","nameLocation":"4352:9:14","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":2343,"src":"4339:22:14","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"memory","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes_memory_ptr","typeString":"bytes"},"typeName":{"id":2320,"name":"bytes","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"4339:5:14","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes_storage_ptr","typeString":"bytes"}},"visibility":"internal"}],"src":"4324:38:14"},"returnParameters":{"id":2325,"nodeType":"ParameterList","parameters":[{"constant":false,"id":2324,"mutability":"mutable","name":"","nameLocation":"-1:-1:-1","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":2343,"src":"4386:7:14","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"},"typeName":{"id":2323,"name":"address","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"4386:7:14","stateMutability":"nonpayable","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"}},"visibility":"internal"}],"src":"4385:9:14"},"scope":2594,"src":"4308:227:14","stateMutability":"pure","virtual":false,"visibility":"internal"},{"body":{"id":2389,"nodeType":"Block","src":"4922:203:14","statements":[{"assignments":[2359],"declarations":[{"constant":false,"id":2359,"mutability":"mutable","name":"s","nameLocation":"4940:1:14","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":2389,"src":"4932:9:14","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes32","typeString":"bytes32"},"typeName":{"id":2358,"name":"bytes32","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"4932:7:14","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes32","typeString":"bytes32"}},"visibility":"internal"}],"id":2366,"initialValue":{"commonType":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes32","typeString":"bytes32"},"id":2365,"isConstant":false,"isLValue":false,"isPure":false,"lValueRequested":false,"leftExpression":{"id":2360,"name":"vs","nodeType":"Identifier","overloadedDeclarations":[],"referencedDeclaration":2350,"src":"4944:2:14","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes32","typeString":"bytes32"}},"nodeType":"BinaryOperation","operator":"&","rightExpression":{"arguments":[{"hexValue":"307837666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666","id":2363,"isConstant":false,"isLValue":false,"isPure":true,"kind":"number","lValueRequested":false,"nodeType":"Literal","src":"4957:66:14","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_rational_57896044618658097711785492504343953926634992332820282019728792003956564819967_by_1","typeString":"int_const

We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications. Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}. This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit these events, as it isn't required by the specification.

tension of ERC20 to support Compound-like voting and delegation.

NOTE: If exact COMP compatibility is required, use the {ERC20VotesComp} variant of this module. This extension keeps a history (checkpoints) of each account's vote power. Vote power can be delegated either by calling the {delegate} function directly, or by providing a signature to be used with {delegateBySig}. Voting power can be queried through the public accessors {getVotes} and {getPastVotes}. By default, token balance does not account for voting power. This makes transfers cheaper.
